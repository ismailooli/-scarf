 creating a chrome extension that tells you what to wear depending on the weather at your location


currently: have a working chrome extension that runs on HTML/CSS/JavaScript

next steps:
- automatically get the users location from the web browser so that the user doesnt have to input anything
- web scraping clothing websites to provide the user with an example of the clothing they can buy/wear
